											identifiers
											-----------
															

like other language python is also CaseSensetive. it take 'a' and 'A' both in different manner for identifie.
identifier is a name which are used to identifie Name like Variable_Name, Function_Name, Class_Name.
python also give some rules to define the name of identifiers.
1.  We can use symbols's (UpperCase % Lower case).
2.  We can also use the numbers(0 to 9).
3.  We can also use '_' underscore for indentifie the identifier.
4.  We can use the name as like First alphabate + Second numbers (abc123) etc.
==========================================================================================================
But there some limitation for identifier.
1. we can not use the other symbols like ($,| <, ?) etc.
2. we can not use first number + second alphabate (123abc) ,so compiler will give the error message.



for example=> 
				 
				>>>def f1():				
				>>>print("hello")																		
				>>>
				>>>f1()				#Name of function 
				hello				#printing the Statement 
				>>>>a=10			# Name of variable

 for example of valid or in valid identifier's

 1.  >>> a=12						# Valid
 2.  >>> A =12						# Valid
 3.  >>> A12=234					# Valid
 4.  >>> a23=1231					# Valid
 5.  >>> abc123abc=134				# Valid
 6.  >>> 123abc123=14				# invalid
 7.  >>> 123abc=13					# invalid
 8.  >>> 123ABC=123					# invalid
 

important thing is that we can use very big very big name of identifier as Name 
for Example:- 
				

				>>> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=12      # Valid


				in python it is also valid we can assign how much big name we want to put but it is called bed programming skill
